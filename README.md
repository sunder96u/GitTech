# GitTech

GitTech
A social media page for those in the tech industry.
The goal of this web page is to create a social media page for just those in the tech industry where they would be able to easily share their code with friends to brag, ask for help, or just use it to teach others a cool thing they just learned.
Being linked to Github will allow the users to quickly and easily view the other persons Github or linkedIn accounts.
